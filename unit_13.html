      <h3>What Is Unit 13?</h3>
      <p>
        Unit 13 is website development, being able to create and design a website to a given scenario. For the scenario, we are working as a 'Junior Web Developer'
        completely designing and creating a phone website from scratch. I have named my website 'ICUPhones'.

      <h3>Designing</h3>
      <p>
        When designing a website, it must look presentable and eye catching to view. For my design I have chosen to create
        a simple design with a navigation bar in a coloum with the colour scheme of a simple light blue with a image background
        with a light blue background for each of the containers. The reasoning for a image background is becuase it should help blend in the
        other parts of the site together.
        <br>
        <br>
        But to start, we must create: A Storyboard (outlines the layout of the site), a site map (a structure of the directory's) &
        a test plan (conduct different tests to see the strengths & weaknesses of the sites functionality & to see what needs improvement).
        Also when making the assets for the site, we must create a asset list stating all details about the image.

      <h3>Creating</h3>
      <p>
        When creating a website in HTML, you take into consideration about the 'User Requirements' & 'Web Constrictions'.
        <br>
        <br>
        The 'User Requirements' mean that it must be: responsive, robust & interactiable.
        <br>
        The 'Web Constrictions' being: hardware dependent, screensize, budget & feedback.
        <br>
        <br>
        Having your webite responsive to adjust to different screensizes makes the website feel flexable as it will
        be able to work on any size. Also my design consists of having a image background which could be a problem as it could
        cause issues involving quaily and site speed. This is something I will have to tackle.
