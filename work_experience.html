      <h3>Work Experience</h3>
      <p>
        For my current Work Experience, I am doing volunteer work at 'The Norfolk Hospice'. My current work hours are from 9am - 1pm.
        This means I only work 4 hours a day, 3 days a week which makes 12 hours total in a week.
        <br>
        <br>
        What I do is dependent upon what needs to be completed for the day. This either being: Stacking Shelf's or Out Back Pricing Products.
        When stacking shelfs, we have to recognise each price label as it will have a Week Number assigned to it. We then need to look for products on display which are a lower Week Number and must switch the
        old products with the newer ones. Depending on what product gets taken off, it either goes on the 'Free Track' or out back to be transported away.

        When pricing products, we must first check to see if they are 'Gift Aided'. This means that each item you donate allows us to claim 25p for every Â£1 that you donate.
        We must find a sutable price relating to the type of product and then the 'Week Number' to tally how old it is.
