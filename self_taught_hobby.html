      <h3>What Is It?</h3>
      <p>
        During the years of playing games, I have become fond of learning how games work internally. 
        With this being said, through the years Ive taught myself a very complicated, and some may say a time consuming, hobby.
        Yes, I enjoy playing games but ive always been fasinated on learning different games design being the coding itself and the different assets it has to offer. This being:
        Audio, Textures, Animations, Models, etc. 
        For are the easiest to understand has been 'Unreal Engine' Games. 'Unreal Engine' is a game engine created by 'Epic Games'.
        This program enables game developers and creators to create next-generation real-time 3D content and experiences.
        The engine has amazing graphic quality & usability. And even uses the C++ programming language.

      <h3>Datamining</h3>
        Most 'Unreal Engine' games use the file format 'PAK'. This is one or more files with condence all game data. Without the proper applications, it is impossible to view inside the files and export assets.
        The current tools I use are 'FModel' & 'Umodel'. These programs all built with file exploring in mind.
        <br>
        <br>
        FModel can be used for old and new Unreal Engine games and read / extract almost every file however you want but unfortunitly one downside is that animations are not supported.
        Audio files are most certainly the strong side of this program as it can identify nearly all formats.
        <br>
        <br>
        Umodel can only read older versions of Unreal Engine games, but still has more of an advantage when it comes to viewing files. Umodel cannot export in as many formats but
        is used for viewing models and animations exellently.
        <br>

        <br>
        When going through files are can export with a seclected file format. This will differ depending on what file you are trying to export.
        (Models & Animations can be exported in PSK/PSA, Textures can be exported in PNG/DAE/JPG)
        Also depending on what you may be extracting, some files may have valuable. This is becuase you may find something you never knew was in the game or if it is an early version/unused file.
        I feel when doing this, also helps to appreacicate how much time and effort a people put into a game.

      <h3>Honorable Mention</h3>
      <p>
        One game in preticular which has been stuck with me since launch has been 'FNAF Security Breach' by Steel Wool Studios.
        There is a number of reasons why this game is special to me and why it has helped with the information above.
        Firstly, this game has drawn me into datamining more then other games becuase of the uniquenesses of the games animations, sounds and loving characters.
        Secondly, this game has always been with me when times are low and has always been a fun experience to break / glitch different features to understand the inner mechanics.
