      <h3>Achievements</h3>
      <p>
        I have earned a good amount of achievements in my working school life, but many involve personal achievements involving different topics.
        Firstly in primary & secondary school, Ive always been good at English and have now passed a sussesful grade for both Literature & Language. I was able to acheive this
        goal by having exellent teachers supporting me along the way.
        <br>
        <br>
        &bull; GCSE English Literature & Language - Grade 4
        <br>
        &bull; GCSE Computer Science - Grade 3
        <br>
        &bull; GCSE Science - Grade 3.3
        <br>
        &bull; GCSE Maths - Grade 3
        <br>
        <br>
        But mainly, most of my achievements would be working on different units and understanding different aspects of life along the way.
        When going through life you will discover what pastions you enjoy, which for me is computing. This is a personal achievement because
        not everyone does the same thing when using computers and not everyone can understand every little aspect. I devote my spare time understanding & exploring new ways of 
        how something works, how things can be improved upon and to help other people understand easily. 
        <br>
        <br>
        When I was in secondary school, computing wasnt really a strong point and I had only the basics covered which is why I deciced to learn more.
        We firstly started to use a programing language called 'Python'. At first it was very hard to keep track off hense no experience
        But since, I feel pretty strong using it. However since starting college, we are now using 'Visual Studio Code' (HTML).
        This is a more professional coding program for website making but not for games - unlike Python which can be used for both.
        But inconclution, HTML as been easier to understand and I feel very confident using it on a weekly basis which is an achievement.

        <h3>Milestones</h3>
        For milestones, the next step up would be learning a proper game coding, being 'C++'. This would be a perfect milestone to reach
        as I somewhat already know some coding details of C++, as its mainly used in Unreal Engine Games and can be written in 'Visual Studio'.
        I explain more on this page: 
        <a href ="Self Taught Hobby.html">SELF TAUGHT HOBBY</a>.
        <br>
        <br>
        Other milestones include different skills I would want to work on for jobs in the future.
        For instance, one skills I would need to work on would be leadership. Having great leadership is present in playing games and in employment.
        Having strong leadership can help motivate a team and can help boost motivation and when in games - 
        taking the lead can help your team follow you to victory.
